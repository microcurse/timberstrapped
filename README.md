# This is my Timber powered starter theme

This theme is going to be using Bootstrap and sass for standard responsive styling. It also uses gulp for package management. 

You can use 'gulp' to watch for file changes.

Credits go to JeyKeu for his Bootstrap powered Timber theme. I took some inspiration from his theme to help build this one.

This theme is still a work in progress.
